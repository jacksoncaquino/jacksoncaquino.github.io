  <p><a href= "#">Data Cleaning for Compensation Survey data from a zip file and multiple sheets to Workday consumable format</a><br>
  One of our compensation survey vendors give us data on a challenging format. It comes with a zip file full of folders with many unnecessary Excel files and some necessary files. This tool unzips everything, sorts what is important versus whatâ€™s not, consolidates all the files, rearranges columns, extracts information from other tabs, and puts together a bigger data frame with the information we need to upload into our system. Coded in Python.</p>
  <p><a href= "#">Data cleaning and consolidation of data from several survey vendors into one market composite</a><br>
  Data that comes from our system is not ready to be used. This tool consolidates three huge files into one file that is ready for the compensation team to use to get the market data from.</p>
  <p><a href= "#">Outlier detection for compensation range progression by country and levels</a><br>
  Auditing the current compensation structure to spot possible errors in compensation range progression to see if anything is too high or too low.</p>
  <p><a href= "#">Using Economic data to predict pay range progression between levels in a certain country</a><br>
  Looking at several macro-economic indicators to see which ones better correlate with pay range progression and explain why our progressions are different in different countries</p>
  <p><a href= "#">Cost of labor comparison by location</a><br>
  Using currency exchange rates, inflation data, and other internal considerations, merging all this data into one place and analyzing to compare costs between different countries to suggest where to focus hiring efforts.</p>
  <p><a href= "#">Market pay movement rate prediction</a><br>
  Using several economic indicators, as well as data from our survey vendors to try and predict average market movement.</p>
  <p><a href= "#">Pay Ranges mass adjustment prediction</a><br>
  Using internal and external datapoints that the compensation team used to adjust pay range midpoints and try to train a model and see if the model can replace/automate the work that was done by the compensation team. </p>
