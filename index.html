  <H1>Jackson Aquino</H1>
  <p>Compensation Professional or data scientist? Why not both?</p>
  <H1>About Me</H1>
  <p>I am a compensation professional with a Master's degree in Data Science from Bellevue University and an MBA with an emphasis in HR from Brigham Young University.</p>
  <p>When I started my Data Science degree, I was working as an HR Generalist considering exploring a new career outside of HR. Still, when I got my compensation role I quickly fell in love with the area and decided that instead of going into a pure data science role I would use my data science skills to improve my compensation skills. I have been applying statistics and programming to change the way I approach compensation-related problems at the organization where I work.</p>
  <p>I love learning about economic theories and how they impact people's perceptions of their total rewards. I am curious and I am always teaching what I know to other professionals so they can improve their hard skills as well.</p>
  <p>This portfolio showcases some of the projects where I use my skill set to improve my compensation work.</p>
  <p>Besides my data science skills, I am uniquely positioned to manage compensation for the Americas, being fluent in Portuguese, Spanish, and English.</p>
