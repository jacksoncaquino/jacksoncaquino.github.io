<H1>Jackson Aquino's Portfolio</H1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio. I am a compensation professional with a Master's degree in Data Science and an MBA.</p>
<p>When I started my Data Science degree, I was working as an HR Generalist considering exploring a new career outside of HR, but then when I got my compensation role I quickly decided that instead of going into a pure data science role I would use my data science skills to improve my compensation skills. I have been applying statistics and programming to change the way I approach compensation-related problems at the organization where I work.</p>
