<p>Welcome to my portfolio. I am Jackson Aquino.</p>
<H1>About Me</H1>H1
<img class="myimage" src="me.png" width="200">
<p>I am a compensation professional with a Master's degree in Data Science and an MBA.</p>
<p>When I started my Data Science degree, I was working as an HR Generalist considering exploring a new career outside of HR, but then when I got my compensation role I quickly fell in love with the area and decided that instead of going into a pure data science role I would use my data science skills to improve my compensation skills. I have been applying statistics and programming to change the way I approach compensation-related problems at the organization where I work.</p>
<p>This portfolio showcases some of the projects where I use my skillset to improve my compensation work.</p>
<p>Besides my data science skills, I am uniquely positioned to manage compensation for the Americas, being fluent in Portuguese and Spanish as well as in English.</p>
